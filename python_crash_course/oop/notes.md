# OOP Notes

making an object from a class is called instantiation, you work with the instances of a class.

classes can also be extended like other languages.

classes make code more understandable an make it easier for collaboration with others. As the codebase get's more complex the Class can help make the code more readable.

**classes always have a Capital letter:**
ie. class Dog:

**classes also need an **init**() method:**
the init method always runs the code whenever a new instance of Dog is created. the double underscores on both sides of init helps prevent Python's default method names from conflicting with the other defined methods. It also makes the method run automatically.
